# Pizza-Sales-Dashboard

This is my latest learning on Power BI & SQL Server. This time I have come up with a new attempt at "Data Analysis using Power BI & SQL Server". This would be the first of many SQL Projects. This is a Pizza Sales Dashboard created to Analyze the total sales of different types of Pizzas in the store.

Steps involved in the Project:-

ðŸ‘‰ Importing Excel files into SQL Server
ðŸ‘‰ Performed SQL Queries like ðŸ‘‡ :
1. SQL Queries in building Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
2. SQL Queries in creating Daily and monthly Trends.
3. SQL Queries for Percentage of Sales by Category & Size
4. SQL Queries for Top 5 & Bottom Pizza Sales

ðŸ‘‰ Connecting Power BI to SQL DB.
ðŸ‘‰ Data Cleaning using Power Query
ðŸ‘‰ Data Processing in Power BI
ðŸ‘‰ Building Daily Monthly trend Charts
ðŸ‘‰ Building % of Sales by Category & Size
ðŸ‘‰ Adding Insights
ðŸ‘‰ Adding Navigator Button
ðŸ‘‰ Google document has been created to show that Queries were executed
